# **Meditech - Healthcare for all**

To invent a new approach for any new or existing problem takes time and more human efforts to bring it to reality. Instead, we propose an innovative approach to utilize currently available resources in an effective way which means that the expected solution can be achieved in less time. To solve medication and vaccine delivery problems from distributers to their end-user, we propose to collaborate with food delivery startups like DoorDash, Uber Eats, etc. as well as companies like Uber that provide transportation as a service and user their resources of vehicles and delivery agents to hand-deliver medications directly from the manufacturer to users at their home address

## Built With

* [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Declarative Routing for React.js
* [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - Twitter Bootstrap Rebuilt for React

## Features
* User selection: The application supports two user types: Delivery dasher and Customer. Customer refers to anyone who wants to place an order. Dasher refers to anyone who wants to deliver the order.  

* Login: This page supports both user types. It allows them to entire their credentials like username and password. If the user is authenticated the system allows access to the next page. 

* Signup: This page only supports customers to sign up. The system does not provide any signup page for the dasher because of security reasons. They would be authorized inside the system after proper security checks and authentication.

* Dasher Pages:  

    1. List of orders: This page shows a list of orders to the dasher. Each order has a pickup address and a delivery address. Dasher can either reject or accept the button. 

    2. Order Confirmation: This page shows the summary of the orders that are currently in progress. 

* Customer Pages:  

    1. Medical Product: This page will allow customers to select the products by searching time. All the OTC (over-the-counter products) will be supported without prescription. Users can select products from different pharmacies, pay it as the same order but it would be divided into multiple orders according to the pharmacy and can be delivered separately.  

    2. Delivery Details: This page takes in the input of the delivery address of the customer.
